CryptoCoinArbitration v1.1.5

Your obedient servant wrote a software for arbitrage crypto currency, which compares currency pairs on stock exchanges, which allows you to arbitrate by crypto currency and, in principle, to observe the difference in the value of currencies on exchanges when they are purchased. To work with the program you need to create API keys in the accounts on the Bitfinex and Exmo exchange. Access rights for keys can be set to minimum or register new accounts specifically for CryptoCoin Arbitration. You need too put keys in the required fields of the program and press "Start" button. After startup, the data is updated every 30 seconds. I ll continue to add exchanges for now.

CryptoCoinArbitration v1.1.6 Removed some bugs with Exmo causing program to crash

CryptoCoinArbitration v1.1.7 Added Binance
